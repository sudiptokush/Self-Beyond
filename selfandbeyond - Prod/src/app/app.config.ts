        <div class="question">What is Past Life Regression Therapy (PLRT )? </div>
        <div class="answer">It is said that when the cause of our illness is in the 
        present, we may need medicine, physiotherapy, simple advice or change of 
        conditions but when the past makes us ill, PLRT is necessary.</div>
        
        <div class="question">What does this mean?</div>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>When there is a problem in the eye, you see an eye specialist, when you 
        have a backache you go to an orthopaedic, for fever you go to a GP. But what 
        do you do when the present life problems does not seem to have any 
        resolutions?</p>

        <p>PLRT is not a solution for all life’s issues yet as a last resort clients 
        have resolved dysfunctional relationships, freed themselves from addictions, 
        intense fears related to heights, water, fire etc. ,chronic physical ailments 
        or pains, depression, obsessions etc. that do not make any logical sense in 
        current life.</p>
        
        <p>PLRT is a therapeutic model which is internationally acclaimed, 
        scientifically proven and research based. It is based upon the philosophy 
        that we are eternal spiritual beings having human experiences . We incarnate 
        on the physical earth to learn lessons decided even prior to our birth.</p>
        
        <p>We as humans have 3 attributes-mind, body and soul.</p>
        
        <p>Body is the physical part that you see. Soul is prana or vital living force or energy essential for our existence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">What is mind?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Before understanding more about PLRT, let us understand mind. So, what 
                is mind?
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mind is like a ball of energy with its centre at the pit of 
                the stomach having two parts. The small logical part is called 
                the conscious part that thinks analyses and decides and the much 
                larger and powerful part called the subconscious part that stores 
                all life experiences, life patterns and belief systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subconscious mind operates like a tape recorder, 
                indiscriminately recording and storing every event that takes 
                place. While the conscious mind may refuse to acknowledge the 
                more painful or terrifying events of life, the subconscious 
                mind never shuts down. It records everything right from the 
                time you took your first breath, or the prenatal time or the 
                life between life times or even past life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regression therapy is a journey into the subconscious. When the 
                subconscious mind is tapped, traumatic incidents from previous 
                lifetimes may be recalled that continue to affect an individual 
                in the current lifetime as well. Past life therapy entails 
                reliving such incidents till catharsis happens and healing takes 
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLRT is quite effective in easing physical pain. It demonstrates 
                that physical pain may be due to past painful or traumatic 
                experiences wherein emotions get locked in the form of cellular 
                memories in the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLRT does not eliminate the need for medical treatment. We do 
                not ask our clients to stop medication or any medical treatment 
                but rather use it as a complimentary tool to make recovery more 
                effective. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From medical point of view, the most interesting thing about 
                past life therapy is that it establishes a connection between 
                mind and body. Most doctors accept the fact that the mind 
                profoundly affects the body. This is readily apparent in diseases 
                such as migraine and ulcers .To illustrate how mind can affect 
                body…. think what happens to you when you hear some good news, 
                say your son is coming home after a long time. The thought in the 
                mind incites a happy emotion which brings a surge of energy in 
                your being and your body feels energized and hence healthy. 
                Conversely, when you hear bad news, what happens to your mind? 
                The mind feels upset or sad followed by a drain of energy from 
                your body. Your body which may have been a very healthy body 
                suddenly feels fatigued or you get a headache or stomach ache. 
                Do you see how quickly the thoughts in mind affect the body?
            </p>
            <p>
                What is less frequently realised is that a psychological 
                component exists for many physical diseases. Similarly, for 
                psychological problem, patients may identify a physical injury 
                in past life. For instance, in regression therapy session a 
                person having intense fear of height could trace the origin of 
                the fear to a past life where the reason of death was probably 
                a fatal fall from a cliff. Similarly, the fear of deep waters 
                may have its roots in a drowning experience in a past life.

            <div class="case-study-title">CASE STUDY I</div>
            <div class="case-study-content">
                <p>
                    This is about a young woman who came to me with the issue of 
                    restlessness, sleeplessness and anxiety which had developed 
                    after her recent visit to Haridwar; she also suffered from 
                    fear of deep waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since her childhood, she was very fascinated about visiting 
                    Haridwar and when she recently did get a chance to go to 
                    Haridwar to perform the last sacred rites of her deceased 
                    grandfather, she suddenly started getting Déjà vu feelings 
                    and everything about the place seemed familiar to her. 
                    After her return to Kolkata, she was haunted by the same 
                    images of Haridwar time and again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When she went into regression, she vividly recalled her past 
                    life experience in Haridwar, where she was physically abused 
                    and pushed off the ghat to finally drown in the river Ganges. 
                    One session of therapy was enough to resolve her restlessness
                    and loss of sleep and also overcome her fear for deep waters.
                    For confidentiality issues, I am not taking her name and also
                    have sought her permission to share her story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regression to the past, we mean, going back to that 
                    past that still continues to interfere with our present. In 
                    therapy, clients are regressed to the time and place where 
                    the original activating event occurred. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study">
            <div class="case-study-title">CASE STUDY II</div>
            <div class="case-study-content">
                <p>
                    Another client of mine had intense fear for fire, so much so,
                    that he was uncomfortable to even light a match. When he was
                    regressed, he went back to a traumatic childhood experience 
                    when he was two year old and had got burnt by crackers. The 
                    experience of the two year old child, was stuck in him with 
                    all his feelings and problems, till he was healed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To check for any other undigested residues, when he was 
                    further regressed, he went back to a past lifetime where his
                    house was burnt in flames with a loved one trapped inside. 
                    This brings to light the fact that he had been carrying the 
                    problematic past within him as unresolved shadow or 
                    undigested residue from past life time and would have had 
                    continued to carry it, had he not undergone a therapy 
                    session.

        <div class="question">What Happens in PLRT?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                A therapeutic regression assimilates such events by reliving, 
                releasing and integrating them so that they do not haunt the 
                client any longer. He can also see the connection between the 
                past and present life and understand the influence and impact 
                that it has had upon the current life. Re-experiencing that life 
                and reprocessing the impact brings a closure to the past events 
                and enables him to progress and empower himself in the present.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, apart from resolving traumatic experiences patients 
                have also visited positive past lives only to integrate any 
                talents, skills, art or science in the present life and to learn
                the truth about themselves, essence of life and magnificence of 
                the soul. They have successfully accessed their strengths to 
                increase their confidence and effectiveness in the present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even for people who are not sure of past lives and think that 
                their mind has woven mere stories of imagination are surprised 
                by the effectiveness of the resolution of their issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that it really does not matter whether a past life 
                exists or not. What really matters is the liberation and peace 
                a person experiences after the therapy session.
